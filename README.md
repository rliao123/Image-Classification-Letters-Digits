# Image-Classification-Letters-Digits
## Project Description
This project aims to create a neural network model to identify and classify images of English alphabet letters and the digits 0 to 9. The model will be trained on a large dataset of images of the characters. The characters could be handwritten characters or characters that appear on different objects. The objective of the project would be to create a character recognition program that identifies letters and numbers from images with high accuracy and good performance. The project was developed using the PyCharm IDE. 
## Obtaining Dataset 
Kaggle Dataset containing the images can be found at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kentvejrupmadsen/letter-images-dataset. The original Kaggle dataset consisted of classes for Scandinavian letters and other symbols such as parentheses and ampersand, in addition to the English letters and numbers. The total number of images was about 64,800. Due to computational capacity limitations, only the English alphabet letters and digits 0-9 were used in the image classification. For the project, there were a total of 50,892 files belonging to 36 classes (26 alphabet letters and digits 0 to 9) and the dataset was split into training, validation, and test sets at 80%, 10%, 10% respectively.
